## Sensor Changes

### 2022 Additions

Two new sensors were added in 2022:

- 188 Quay Street Lower Albert (EW)
- 188 Quay Street Lower Albert (NS)

These sensors have `NaN` values for 2019-2021. See [Missing Data](missing-data.qmd) for how to handle this.

### 2025 Camera Upgrades

On **5 March 2025**, five sensors were upgraded to wider recording zones:

- 30 Queen Street
- 205 Queen Street
- 210 Queen Street
- 261 Queen Street
- 297 Queen Street

Counts from these sensors may show a step-change from this date. Heart of the City captures the additional area separately — contact them for disaggregated data.

## Data Quality

### Completeness

- **2019-2021**: 100% complete for 19 sensors
- **2022**: 91.8% complete (startup gaps for new sensors)
- **2023**: 99.9% complete
- **2024-2025**: 100% complete

### Missing Data Patterns

Missing values arise from three sources:

1. **Sensors not yet installed** (structural missingness)
2. **Sensor downtime/maintenance** (temporary gaps)
3. **Data transmission failures** (rare, short gaps)

See [Missing Data](missing-data.qmd) for detailed analysis and handling strategies.

## Inspect Coverage

Use `describe_missing()` to get a detailed report:

```{python}
#| eval: false
from akl_ped_counts import describe_missing

report = describe_missing()

# Sensors with >1% missing data
print(report.query("pct_missing > 1"))

# Summary by year
print(report.groupby("year")["pct_missing"].mean())
```
